# Angular-Django-JWT-Example
## Mood Indigo Web and Tech CG selection assignment
In this assignment I've used Angular 8 as front-end and Django at back-end to create a JWT (Json Web Token) authentication chat platform.

I've used Angular due to the following reasons:
- I've experience in Angular as I've worked before developing the official MI website in the platform
- The codebase is much cleaner in Angular and it is an ideal platoform for small scale websites with limited functionality

The project is divided in two submodules:
- The Angular Front End which can also be accessed from [here][https://github.com/AnujAgrawal30/Angular-JWT-Example]
- The Django Back End which can also be accessed from [here][https://github.com/AnujAgrawal30/Django-JWT-Example]

The detailed instructions on how to set up the seperate applications is provided in the seperate Repositories
